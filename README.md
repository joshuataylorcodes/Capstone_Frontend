# Ezy Set List

- Ezy Set List is an app that musicians can use to create set lists for shows/performances. Musicians can create a song bank that they can use to select which ever songs they would like to use in a set. Within minutes, a set list can be created that includes the approximate length of performance, all the infromation about each song for each band member, and a pdf document to print out for performances. Plan effectivly, Practice efficiently.

React.js was used to build the frontend along with bootstrap templates for the styling of the pages
